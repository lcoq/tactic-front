      `{{moment-format date outputFormat inputFormat}}`

  to better reflect common usage pattern. You are usually passing a date as the first argument, which does not require specifying an inputFormat, and at the same time, you usually do want to specify an output format. [#12](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-moment/pull/12).

    Fixes case of passing both input and output formats, and changes default output format.

    Adds a few more usage examples to dummy app, and improves tests accordingly.

* [BUGFIX] Passing a two arguments to the `moment` helper was not handled properly.
